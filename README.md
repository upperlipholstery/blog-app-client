# Tome
  We are proud to showcase this not so new technology.
  In his application you can sign up and in as a user.
  Each user has the ability to post tomes about anything they
  like. Each tome will be owned by the user who created it and can only be
  modified or removed by the owner. Users also, have the ability to
  leaves notes on other tomes as well. A user can only leave a note and see user stats
  only when they have signed up for an account. Users can still read all tomes without an account.
  Users can also save tomes to the Archive where they can go back and read their favorites

  ## Technologies
    This application was created using the following technologies
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Bootstrap
    * Handlebars
    * JavaScript
    * JQuery
    * AWS
    * Ajax

  ## Goals for V2
  *Give users the ability to comment on a comment to begin a nested discussion
  *Give the owner of a post admin privileges to remove a comment from another
  user should it be deemed inappropriate.

  ## Our Journey
  We began by creating wireframes for the layout of our client side
  application and creating user Stories to brainstorm blog functionality. Once
  we established a solid idea of our functionality we implemented our auth routes.
  We, then, started creating our CRUD functionality over our blog posts,
  implemented comments, and CRUD over our comments. From there we cereated api requests to call different part of the data.
  We styled and finished up our MVP, moving forward we added various features one by one.
  Proiritizing ones that could be completed easily and add the most positive UI experience.
