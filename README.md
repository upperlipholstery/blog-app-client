# Blogadelphia
  We are proud to present to you this cutting edge technology called a Blog.
  Within this application a person will be able to sign up and in as a user.
  After that each user will have the ability to post a blog about anything they
  like. Each blog post will be owned by the user who created it and can only be
  modified or removed by the owning user. Users will, also, have the ability to
  comment on blogs as well. A user can only comment on a blog post after signing
  in and comments can only be modified or removed by the owning user.

  ## Technologies
    This application was created using the following technologies:
    *HTML
    *CSS
    *Bootstrap
    *Handlebars
    *JavaScript
    *JQuery

  ## Goals for V2
  *Give users the ability to comment on a comment to begin a nested discussion
  *Give the owner of a post admin privileges to remove a comment from another
  user should it be deemed inappropriate.

  ## Our Journey
  Our journey began when we realized that we couldn't live without posting our
  most trivial thoughts on the internet in a desperate attempt to catch any
  attention we can whether it be positive or negative it's still sweet, sweet,
  attention.
  We began by creating wireframes for the layout of our client side
  application and creating user Stories to brainstorm blog functionality. Once
  we established a solid idea of our functionality we implemented or auth routes.
  We, then, started creating our CRUD functionality over our blog posts,
  implemented comments, and CRUD over our comments.
